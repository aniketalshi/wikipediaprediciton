Predicts the editing behavior of Wikipedia User



Machine learning and Datamining techniques to predict editing behavior of Wikipedia users

step 1: clustering based datamining technique to extract feature from dataset

step 2: feature selection step 

step 3: training data -> KNN regressor 

step 4: test data

 ./preprocess_moredata.py
 ./prepare.py moredata
 ./experiment.py

 ./prepare.py training
 ./submit.py
